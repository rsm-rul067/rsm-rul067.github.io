They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. \n\nEach recipient was randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments:\n\n- A **standard solicitation letter** (control group)\n- A letter including a **matching donation offer** (treatment group)\n- Variations within the matching group that differed by:\n  - **Match ratio** (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1)\n  - **Maximum match amount** ($25k, $50k, $100k, or unstated)\n  - **Suggested donation level** (e.g., base amount, 1.25x, or 1.5x of prior donation)\n\nThe matching grant was framed as coming from a \"concerned fellow member\" who would match donations received up to a certain amount, providing a perceived **multiplier effect** to the recipient's contribution.\n\nThis design allowed the authors to explore not only the **overall impact of offering a match** on donation rates and amounts, but also to test whether the **size of the match ratio** or the **suggested donation amount** affected donor behavior.\n\nThey published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n\n\nThis project seeks to replicate their results.\n\n\n## Data\n\n### Description\n\n::::

that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\n\n\n#### **1. `mrm2` (Months Since Last Donation)**\n\nWe first test whether the treatment and control groups differ significantly in the number of months since their last donation (`mrm2`). This helps verify whether the randomization process created balanced groups.\n\n::: {#689b2cd0 .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=481}\n```\n(0.0764041463527638, 0.9390978830677066)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> The t-test returns a **t-statistic of 0.076** and a **p-value of 0.939**, indicating no statistically significant difference in the `mrm2` variable between the two groups.\n\nWe also run a regression of `mrm2 ~ treatment` to confirm the result:\n\n::: {#48236e5b .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreg_model = smf.ols('mrm2 ~ treatment', data=df_clean).fit()\nreg_model.params.to_frame(\"coef\").join(reg_model.pvalues.to_frame(\"p-value\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=482}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>coef</th>\n      <th>p-value</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Intercept</th>\n      <td>12.984577</td>\n      <td>0.000000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>treatment</th>\n      <td>0.008835</td>\n      <td>0.939098</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> The estimated coefficient on `treatment` is **0.0088** with a **p-value of 0.939**, again showing no meaningful difference.\n\n\n\n\n#### Summary statistics:\n\n::: {#aeca97ba .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=483}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>mean</th>\n      <th>std</th>\n      <th>count</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>treatment</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>12.984577</td>\n      <td>12.065892</td>\n      <td>16339</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>12.993411</td>\n      <td>12.064867</td>\n      <td>32632</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe table above shows the average number of months since the last donation (`mrm2`) for each group:\n\n- Control group (treatment = 0): **12.98 months**\n- Treatment group (treatment = 1): **12.99 months**\n\nThe means are nearly identical, differing by only **0.0088 months**.  \nThis minimal difference provides strong visual evidence that the groups are balanced on this pre-treatment variable.\n\n#### **Summary Interpretation:**\n\n- **T-test result**: t = 0.076, p = 0.939 → No significant difference\n- **Regression**: treatment coefficient is 0.0088, also not significant\n- **Conclusion**: There is no statistical evidence of a difference in the time since last donation between the treatment and control groups.\n\n\n#### **2. `years` (Years Since First Donation)**\n\nWe now test whether the treatment and control groups differ significantly in the number of years since the individual first donated (`years`).

The visual comparison showed a modest increase in the treatment group.\n- A **t-test** confirmed that this difference is statistically significant (**t = 3.10, p = 0.0019**), suggesting that the treatment effect is not due to random chance.\n- I then estimated an **OLS regression** of `gave ~ treatment`, which indicated that being in the treatment group increased donation probability by approximately **0.42 percentage points**—a meaningful and significant effect.\n- Finally, I fit a **Probit regression** to better model the binary outcome variable. The coefficient on `treatment` was positive and statistically significant (**0.087, p = 0.002**), further confirming the effect.\n\nTogether, these results provide strong evidence that matching donation offers **increase the probability of giving**.  \n\n_NOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions..._\n\n\n### Differences between Match Rates\n\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.

The goal is to demonstrate how the sampling distribution of the mean becomes more normal and more concentrated as sample size increases.\n\n\nIn this simulation, I repeat the following process 1,000 times for each sample size:\n\n1. Draw `n` binary donation outcomes from the control group (p = 0.018)\n2. Draw `n` binary donation outcomes from the treatment group (p = 0.022)\n3. Compute the mean difference between the two samples\n4.
