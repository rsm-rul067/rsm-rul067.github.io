The results are as follows:\n\n- **T-test statistic**: 0.076  \n- **P-value**: 0.939  \n  → This high p-value indicates that there is **no statistically significant difference** between the two groups.\n\nIn addition, we estimate a simple OLS regression of the form:\n\n```text\nmrm2 ~ treatment\n```\n\nThe estimated coefficient on `treatment` is **0.0088** with a **p-value of 0.939**, again showing no meaningful difference.\n\n#### Summary statistics for `mrm2`:\n\n| Group         | Mean    | Std. Dev | N      |\n|---------------|---------|----------|--------|\n| Control (0)   | 12.9846 | 12.0659  | 16,339 |\n| Treatment (1) | 12.9934 | 12.0649  | 32,632 |\n\nThese results confirm that the treatment assignment was successfully randomized with respect to this variable. In other words, the treatment and control groups were balanced on `mrm2` prior to the intervention, supporting the internal validity of the experimental design.\n\n\n### Balance Test: Years Since First Donation (`years`)\n\nWe also test whether the treatment and control groups are balanced in terms of `years`, the number of years since the individual first donated to the organization. This variable reflects donor tenure and long-term engagement.\n\nUsing a two-sample t-test, we find:\n- **T-statistic** = -1.194  \n- **P-value** = 0.232  \n→ This suggests no statistically significant difference between the groups.\n\nWe confirm this result using an OLS regression:\n\n```text\nyears ~ treatment\n```\n\nFrom the regression output:\n- The coefficient on `treatment` is **-0.0631**\n- **P-value** = 0.232\n\n#### Summary statistics for `years`:\n\n| Group         | Mean   | Std. Dev | N      |\n|---------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Control (0)   | 6.1406 | 5.6365   | 16,339 |\n| Treatment (1) | 6.0775 | 5.4542   | 32,632 |\n\nAs with `mrm2`, the results provide no evidence of imbalance, confirming that the random assignment was successful for this variable as well.\n\n\n### Balance Test: Frequency of Prior Donations (`freq`)\n\nThe third variable we examine is `freq`, which captures the number of past donations made by each individual. This variable helps us evaluate whether treatment and control groups are equally experienced in giving.\n\nA two-sample t-test yields:\n- **T-statistic** = -0.111  \n- **P-value** = 0.912  \n→ This indicates **no significant difference** in donation frequency between the groups.\n\nWe verify this result with a linear regression:\n\n```text\nfreq ~ treatment\n```\n\nIn the OLS regression:\n- The coefficient on `treatment` is **-0.012**\n- **P-value** = 0.912\n\n#### Summary statistics for `freq`:\n\n| Group         | Mean   | Std. Dev | N      |\n|---------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Control (0)   | 8.047  | 11.404   | 16,687 |\n| Treatment (1) | 8.035  | 11.390   | 33,396 |\n\nThese results confirm that the treatment and control groups were also well-balanced on donation frequency prior to the intervention.\n\n\nThese balance tests show that the treatment and control groups do not significantly differ across key characteristics. This suggests that the random assignment was successful and supports the internal validity of the experimental results.\n\n# Experimental Results\n\n## Charitable Contribution Made\n\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\n\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\n\n#### The bar plot shows a higher donation rate in the treatment group.\n\n#### A t-test confirms that this difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0019). Linear regression estimates that receiving the match offer increases donation likelihood by 0.42 percentage points.\n\n#### Understanding the OLS Regression Output\n\nThe OLS regression estimates the following model:\n\n```text\ngave ~ treatment\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `gave` is a binary variable indicating whether someone donated (1 = yes, 0 = no)\n- `treatment` is 1 if the individual received a matching donation offer, and 0 otherwise\n\nIn this model:\n- The **intercept** represents the **average donation rate in the control group**\n- The **coefficient on `treatment`** represents the **difference in donation rates between the treatment and control groups**\n\nFrom our regression:\n- Intercept = **0.0179** → This matches the donation rate in the control group: **1.79%**\n- Treatment coefficient = **0.0042** → This means the treatment group donated **0.42 percentage points more** than the control group\n\nThese numbers exactly match our earlier manual calculations:\n- Control group donation rate: **0.017858**\n- Treatment group donation rate: **0.022039**\n- Difference: **0.004181**\n\nThus, the OLS regression provides an alternative but equivalent way of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) in this binary outcome context.\n\n\n#### The probit regression confirms that assignment to the match treatment significantly increased the probability of donating. The coefficient on treatment is positive (0.0868) and statistically significant (p = 0.002), suggesting that matching appeals have a real behavioral impact on charitable decisions.\n\n## Differences between Match Rates\n\n#### In this section, I examine whether higher match ratios (2:1 or 3:1) lead to a higher probability of donation compared to the baseline 1:1 match.\n\nWe conduct two-sample t-tests to compare the response rates across different match ratios:\n\n- **2:1 vs 1:1**  \n  - t = 0.965, p = 0.334 → not statistically significant\n- **3:1 vs 2:1**  \n  - t = 0.050, p = 0.960 → not statistically significant\n\nThese tests suggest that while donation rates rise slightly with higher match ratios, the differences are not statistically meaningful.\n\n#### The donation rate increases slightly as the match ratio increases. However, these differences are relatively small in magnitude.\n\n#### None of the differences are statistically significant at the 5% level. This further supports the conclusion that **larger match ratios do not significantly improve the likelihood of donating**.\n\n# Size of Charitable Contribution\n\n#### While individuals in the treatment group donated slightly more on average ($0.15 more), this difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.063). Thus, we do not find strong evidence that receiving a matching donation offer increases total donation amounts when including non-donors in the analysis.\n\n#### Among those who donated, individuals in the treatment group gave on average $1.67 less than those in the control group. However, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.561). Thus, we find no evidence that receiving the matching offer increases donation amounts conditional on giving.\n\n#### The red vertical lines indicate the sample mean in each group: $45.54 in the control group vs. $43.87 in the treatment group. This confirms the regression results, which show no significant difference in donation size conditional on giving.\n\n#### The cumulative average of the differences between treatment and control stabilizes near the true effect (0.004) as the number of simulations increases.\n\n#### Central Limit Theorem: Simulation Analysis\n\nTo visualize the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), I simulate the distribution of the **average difference in donation probability** between treatment and control groups under different sample sizes.\n\nFor each sample size (50, 200, 500, 1000), I repeat the following steps 1,000 times:\n\n- Draw `n` samples from each group's Bernoulli distribution (p=0.018 for control, p=0.022 for treatment)\n- Compute the difference in sample means\n- Plot the histogram of these 1,000 differences\n\nAs sample size increases:\n- The distributions become **more centered**, **more symmetric**, and **closer to a normal distribution**\n- The red dashed line (0.004) shows the **true treatment effect**, which the distributions begin to cluster around\n\n**In applied statistics, a sample size of just \\( n > 30 \\)** is often considered sufficient for the sampling distribution of the mean to be treated as approximately normal.  \nThis explains why statistical methods relying on normality (e.g., t-tests, confidence intervals) are widely used even when the underlying data is not normally distributed.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Balance Test: Months Since Last Donation (`mrm2`)\n\nTo assess whether the randomization was successful, we test whether the treatment and control groups differ significantly in the number of months since their last donation (`mrm2`), a key pre-treatment variable that captures donors' prior engagement.\n\nWe conduct both a **two-sample t-test** and a **linear regression** to compare means across groups.
